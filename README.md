A async Python library for interating with Bosch Alarm Panels supporting the "Mode 2" API.
Theoretically, the following models support this protocol: Solution 2000/3000, B4512/B5512, B8512G/B9512G.
In practice, this library has only been tested with B8512G and the Solution 2000/3000, and support for additional panels will probably require additional development. PRs welcome!

#### Features
- Retrieving area and point status
- Arming/disarming areas
- Push based updates (for panels that support it)

#### Authentication
- For G series panels, in the "Automation / Remote App" section of panel settings set the "Automation Device" to "Mode 2", and set the "Automation Passcode" to at least 10 characters.
- For the Solution panels, use the same code you use with RSC+ app.
